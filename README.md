# BookXMLReader
 A small learning project I did to learn the different ways you can interact with XML files in C#. 

Hi there, and thanks for taking the time to check out my project! I initially set out to create this 
code as a way to parse XML data given certain parameters. You can set your parameters through the console
interface, and when you are ready to execute your query, use the "Execute Query" command in the main menu.

Small note: if you are using this project with Visual Studio, you may need to set "Copy
to Output" to "Always" in the properties of the Books.xml file.

I hope you enjoy this project! - Lindsey
